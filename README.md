DVD Episode Splitter Helper

You know when you rip a DVD boxset but the episodes are in one long file rather then per episode?
This helps with that.
It fingerprints intro music based on chapter start times, and presents a list of possible episode start chapters to split by, using mkvmerge to process the output.

Currently Proof of Concept, only tested on 1 DVD so far, does not work on episodes with cold opens, outro music may throw off the script, give it a try and let me know.
